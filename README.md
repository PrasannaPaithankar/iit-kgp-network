# 0. Introduction


In this repo, I will write about the problems students face on campus network and attempt to provide solution (feasible or non feasible). The solutions end at Section 3.

In Section 4, I will write in depth discussion on why does few protocols, which are really good, like Wireguard, UDP based VPNs, etc. do not work on campus network. Feel free to skip that section if you are not interested.

Section 5 deals with Contributing rules and Section 6 ends with a vote of thanks to people who helped me in anyway.


# 1. VPNs
 
- **Recommended Solutions**


|VPN|Platform|Status| Reason |
|---|---|---| --- |
| ExpressVPN (Not free) | ![w] ![l] ![a] | ‚úîÔ∏è | Even though paid, its the fastest, most stable and the most secure option out there. |
| OpenVPN hosted on DigitalOcean or AWS ec2 | ![w] ![l] ![a] | ‚úîÔ∏è | This is slower than ExpressVPN but its very much feasible for using on PC/Laptop.<br/> |

‚ÑπÔ∏è  For detailed comparison of OpenVPN on EC2, DigitalOcean and ExpressVPN for `gamers` and `casual users`, see [OpenVPN vs ExpressVPN](#44-openvpn-vs-expressvpn) section. 

- Working Solutions but **not recommended**:

|VPN|Platform|Status| Reason |
|---|---|---| --- |
| Psiphon | ![a] | ‚úÖ | Uses `L2TP/IPsec`. For more info on protocols see [VPN Protocols](#42-vpn-protocols) section.<br/>Slow and requires more CPU consumption. |
| SetupVPN | ![w] ![l] | ‚ö†Ô∏è | No information on which protocols are used.<br/>Maybe unsafe.<br/>Full services for paid users.
| HoxxVPN | ![w] ![l] | ‚ö†Ô∏è | It's not a VPN, its more like a proxy for PC. For browsers, it uses `http tunneling`.<br/>Its unsafe as it uses 4096-RSA, which has already been cracked.

- Not working or untested:

|VPN|Platform|Status| Reason |
|---|---|---| --- |
| Wireguard hosted on any server | ![w] ![l] ![a] | ‚ùå | Uses UDP, which is blocked. More about this under [Packet Filtering](#41-packet-filtering) section |
| Warp (1.1.1.1) | ![w] ![l] ![a] | ‚ùå | Uses Wireguard internally |
| VPNHub |  ![a] | ‚ùå | Could have worked by changing the settings, but that is for paid users only. |
| Tor | ![w] ![l] ![a] | ‚ùå | Tor commonly uses ports 9001 and 9030 for network traffic and directory information - [source](https://wiki.wireshark.org/Tor#protocol-dependencies), which are blocked on network. See more about blocked ports under [Packet Filtering](#41-packet-filtering). |
| NordVpn | ![w] ![a] | ‚ùî | Uses NordLymx (based on Wireguard) by default, it can work as it also supports OpenVPN. But it's paid |
| HotspotShield | ![w] ![l] | ‚ùî | Not yet tested, its paid |

‚ùî : Untested


Conclusion:

- **UDP** based VPNs don't work because UDP is dropped (see [Packet Filtering](#41-packet-filtering)) unless some tunneling is used.
- **TCP** based VPNs work on port `443` as it is allowed. Connection on other ports are reset ( see - issue[#2](https://github.com/sheharyaar/vpn/issues/2) ). OpenVPN and ExpressVPN are the fastest **and** the most secure VPNs available.


## 1.1 Using OpenVPN


To be updated soon.


## 1.2 Observation : ExpressVPN works best


Express VPN works and it works damn fast - it uses `Lightway Protocol` whose core is open sourced now [here](https://github.com/expressvpn/lightway-core) - and a combination of `iptable` rules and `DNS Resolution`.


My speculation is that it runs in TCP Mode and its fast. But I need to verify this by looking at logs and iptable entries. I speculate that `Lightway UDP` doesn't work because I tried it specifically on the Android version of the app, it didn't connect at all where the TCP counterpart connected quickly.


> So the ray of hope is that using the lightway core and iptables we may be able to manage creating out our version of VPN that can be hosted on any server obtained by Student credits.

## Solution

Its not much right now, but I am currently working on it. Reasearching currently about VPNs. I am really new to this, so it's gonna take some time ü•≤

Ignore this section please.

# 2. Slow LAN Speed


To be updated


# 3. Slow WIFI Speed

The institute has a fast Ethernet connection but a notoriously slow Wifi due to its usage of `2.4 ghz` and `20MHz` bandwidth with a Bit-rate of `72.2Mb/s` (Megabits/s). This wifi is shared with many people in the same wing which brings its speed down to 10-12 Mbps.



```console
lagnos@rog:~$ iwconfig wlo1
wlo1      IEEE 802.11  ESSID:"STUDENT_SECURED"
          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.412 GHz  Access Point: E8:BA:70:61:38:E2
          Bit Rate=72.2 Mb/s   Tx-Power=20 dBm
          Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Power Management:on
          Link Quality=50/70  Signal level=-60 dBm
          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
          Tx excessive retries:2004  Invalid misc:5420   Missed beacon:0
```


## 3.1 Best Solution


To be updated


## 3.2 Feasible Solution

**Just buy a router or use raspberry Pi**

**Setting up router :**

Buy a good 300Mbps or (1 Gbps if u are rich) and then use ethernet interface to distribute internet wia the wifi interface.<br/>
Before buying check if it will support OpenWRT, to be able to forward conenctions from ethernet to wifi ( to be used as Access point ) and vice versa.
Setting up can be a bit tedious for beginner but it will give high speed internet.

> Benefits : You can get 300Mbps internet, and even if u share with 3 room mates u still get arorund 100 Mbps in the worst case scenario which is much better than getting 12-13 Mbps on Wifi

**For Raspberry Pi :**

- The logic is same, route the connections on Wifi interface via the ethernet interface.
- Buy a 150/300 Mbps usb adapter which is **capable of AP mode** (verify before buying).

For detailed config : Check out my post [here](./rpi-express.md).

> Benefits : As in the previous solution you can get much better speed than the institute wifi and can enjoy online streaming. Cheers!



# 4. Discussion


This section is a read for people who wish to know why various protocols like Wireguard or OpenVPN did not work. Anything that is written here are my observations and may not be absolutely correct. If you find any error please open an issue and inform me about it to make this repository more accurate. This is going to be a long read, so buckle up üöÄ.

I feel blocking of UDP is a major culprit in VPNs not working. I am not sure but the topics here I discuss will be updated, because I will try my best to verufy those with supporting resources.

There is packet filtering (speculated too) as the network prohibits the use of ceritifcates for the connection and uses `PEAP + MSChapv2` which is very much vulnerable.  Credentials can be cracked easily. So it's better to use implement some security methods. For more info lookup : `chapcrack` on Google.


## 4.1 Packet Filtering

| Protocol | Status | Proof | Remarks |
| ---  | --- | --- | --- |
| UDP  | üü† | <ul><li>The network connected well to server hosted on Cloud on non standard port `55555` over UDP.</li></ul>  | <ul><li> UDP works and connects to an external server on any unused port, other than the standard ports.</li><li> As common ports are most probably blocked, services like `DNS` doesn't work. Hence programs depending on DNS-name resolution like `dig` and `nslookup` won't work. The server is able to use **only the DNS provided by campus network DHCP** </li><li>To make DNS work we need `iptables` magic on Linux. This `iptables` is used by expressvpn to forward DNS requests. Read More in Discussions.</li></ul> |        
| TCP  | üü† | <ul><li>Server hosted on cloud could be connected via `netcat` and `telnet` without issues on port `55555` and similar private ports.</ul>|<ul><li>TCP Based VPNs do work even though very much slow</li><li>Servers outside the campus network can be accessed over TCP comfortably, on any unused port other than the common ports.</li><li>`tor` cannot be used (TCP over LTS) as it cannot connect to the nodes.</li><li> Need to check tor on a private port and update info.</ul>|
| ICMP | ‚ùå | <ul><li>`ping` and `traceroute` doesn't work at all</li></ul> | <ul><li>ICMP packets are plainly dropped displaying normal firewall behaviour.</li></ul> |


‚ÑπÔ∏è **Very Important Note** : Externally hosted servers can be accessed on private ports via both TCP and UDP. The problem is that a ` internally hosted server cannot be exposed to the external network`. Creation of socket on the all itnerface (0.0.0.0) requires resolution of hostname by the function `getnameinfo` which requires DNS resolution - which doesn't work due to the firewall. My strong speculation is that this can too be bypassed using `iptables` or `ngrok`.

# 5. Contributing

For tasks, take a look at [To Do section](#2-to-do). All help is appreciated. Please create a new issue to contribute. For VPN testing tasks, attach/enter the following data (even if the VPN failed ) :

For all systems : 

- Error or warning messages if any.
- If the VPN failed or worked
- If the VPN worked, check `DNS Leak` from here (any of the standard or extended test) : [https://www.dnsleaktest.com/](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/results.html) .DNS Leak test is **passed** only if the IP addresses shown in the results are the IP address assigned buy the VPN. Enter either *passed* or *failed* for this.

:warning: DNS Leak test is important as the institute does filter DNS requests. Please don't open any blocked website right away before check the DNS Leak Test. First perform the test, then verify the IP location at atleast 2 website service online.

For Linux tests only :

- Name of the dns resolver used by your system.
- Contents of `/etc/resolv.conf` before and after using the vpn.
- `iptables` rules before and after using the vpn.

‚ÑπÔ∏è VPN Tests on Linux is preferred as it will provide much more information than the other OS.

For protocol testing tasks, please attach the following:
- The method of testing
- Screenshots or outputs from various programs if used like, `tcpdump` , `wireshark`, etc.
